      and society. Our programs foster critical thinking, communication skills,
      and a rich appreciation for the human experience. We offer a diverse
      curriculum that includes literature, history, sociology, psychology, and
      the performing arts. Students are encouraged to engage in intellectual
      discussions and creative projects that prepare them for a variety of
      career paths, including education, media, public service, and the arts.
